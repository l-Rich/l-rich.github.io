THE BUDGET APP
Hackaton

⭐ This app was created to make a budget for a household, or a trip, or whatever you need to budget out your life. The idea was to add line for the expense and the app will tally it all at the bottom. 

⭐ The app was created using GO. I was tasked with learning the new language and that took a lot of work looking through videos, reading documentation, and a lot of trial and error. This was also made with React and Mongo DB, both technologies I was familiar with. 

⭐ The biggest challenge here was to connect the database. In class, we never learned how to connect a database like MongoDB. I had to learn on documentation a lot for that. I also wanted to place different budget lines in catergories and to output a graphic so you can see where your money is going. (JF 1.1)

MOCKTAILS
Front End

⭐ This app was created to showcase my skills in front-end web site developement. The app catergories different cocktail recipes and allows for some filtering and searching. I wanted to choose something that I had an opportunity to put more showcasing to the animations and other CSS

⭐ I chose to use Angular because that is what I chose to learn for this project. I also implemented bootstrap and SCSS for styling purposes. 

⭐ The biggest challenge I had with this app was with the API. The API had a bug with the end points. To combat that issue I hard coded all the recipe info into the code and connected the database to the code. (JF 4.3)

THE CIRCLE CHAT
Back End Module Project

⭐ We wanted to create a real time messaging app. 

⭐ As a group we worked using a git collaboration board and used github and pair programming. This was a huge undertaking with the socket.io server. We also used HTML, CSS, Vite, Passport.JS,  and React

⭐ I was responsible for connecting the socket and the functionality of the live chating. The biggest blocker we had was connecting the socket server. It was very difficult to turn the server on for the socket and have the correct endpoints. We needed the app to also update automatically and send the response to the receiver. (JF 6.6)

LMAO 90's TODO LIST
Deployment Module Project

⭐ This project was to demostrate our understanding of deployement. We chose a simple task like a to-do list to spend more time showcasing the user models and being able to authenticate a user

⭐ We used passport JS, React, Node, and Express. We pair programmed and collaborated using Github.

⭐ Most of my time was spent building the frontend and UI. I was responsibile for preparing the UI for the code for authentication
